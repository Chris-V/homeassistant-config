# TODOs
## Bugs
- Hue Hub incorrectly reports as offline

## Scenes
_Maybe with more devices ðŸ˜Ÿ_

## Automations
- Turn off everything when no one is home

### Turn on porch light and beside lamps:
- Sunset minus 30m triggers AND family is home
- Family arrives AND sun is below_horizon AND time is before midnight

### Turn on porch light for 5 minutes:
- Someone arrives AND sun is below_horizon AND time is after midnight
- Will need to list relevant people in the trigger because family may be 'home' if only one person is home

### Turn off porch light:
- Midnight

### Wake Up
- Contribute weekday support in triggers?
- Light temp. is too cold
- Wed-Fri times are too late
